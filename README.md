Computational neuroscience models of the primate visual cortex based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) using the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron model.

Stimulus: artificial data (moving bars) used in ds_models and event camera recordings (hand-held camera moving in an office environment) used in of_models.

Learning: Spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and backpropagation to achieve selectivity for motion directions and optic flow patterns.
